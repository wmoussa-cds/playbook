title: Choose the stack carefully
---

The technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud-based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, because of their widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies in the private sector. 

### Skills to work on

1. Does the skills base of the community line up with the requirements of supporting the stack in the near and long term? 
1. Is there sufficient maturity with the developer tooling on the stack?
1. Have the maintenance needs of the stack been considered? Will customizations increase maintenance unnecessarily?
1. Does the technology stack have reasonable security management / patching in place?
1. Have additional technology dependencies been considered and rationalized?
