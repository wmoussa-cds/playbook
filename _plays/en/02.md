The greatest and most wide ranging benefit of Continuous Integration is reduced risk. It also allows you to detect issues sooner. It is a fail-fast mechanism and removes one of the biggest barriers to frequent deployment.

### Skills to work on
1. Integrate changes into a mainline as early as possible. 
1. Define your peer review process and documentation. Start with a pull request template. Run code reviews like a human. 
1. Use SemVer to version your changes
1. Enforce Conventional Commits. See why.
