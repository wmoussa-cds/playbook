title: Use feature toggles
---

Allows incomplete and untested code paths to be shipped to production as latent code and turned on when the new feature is ready. Using Release Toggles in this way is the most common way to implement the Continuous Delivery principle of "separating *feature* release from *code* deployment."

### Skills to work on

1. Install, implement or use an existing feature toggle platform 
1. Practice writing code using [branch by abstraction](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BranchByAbstraction.html)
1. Deploy large feature in smaller pieces
1. Avoid releasing new code outside business hours or just before the weekend or bank holidays
