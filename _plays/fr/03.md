title: Rendre les choses simples et intuitives
---

Using a government service shouldn’t be stressful, confusing, or daunting. It’s our job to build services that are simple and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time, unaided.

### Checklist

1. Use a simple and flexible design style guide for the service. Use the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) as a default
2. Use the design style guide consistently for related digital services
3. Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process
4. Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service
5. Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process
6. Use language that is familiar to the user and easy to understand
7. Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including online and offline touch points

### Key Questions

- What primary tasks are the user trying to accomplish?
- Is the language as plain and universal as possible?
- What languages is your service offered in?
- If a user needs help while using the service, how do they go about getting it?
- How does the service’s design visually relate to other government services?
