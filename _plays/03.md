title: Deploy often
---

Frequent deployment is valuable because it allows your users to get new features more rapidly, to give more rapid feedback on those features, and generally become more collaborative in the development cycle. This helps break down the barriers between users of our services and developers - which are the biggest barriers to successful software development.

### Skills to work on
1. Deploy updated code into production environments multiple times a day in a structured and safe way. 
1. Create environments through infrastructure as code
1. Use hermetic builds via container images and store them in the Cloud
1. Every application or system should have a release checklist or an agile release train defined
1. Keep a release manifest file that links releases and component versions. Here is one simple example. 
1. Automate your release notes
1. Always provide a rollback play by play for each release
1. Leverage a green/blue deployment
1. If possible, use techniques to throttle traffic to the new release e.g. canary release
1. Ensure each release candidate is properly tested (manually or automatically).  Testing should cover: unit tests, integration tests and performance tests.
1. Ensure each release candidate has gone through a vulnerability scan
1. Always verify/monitor production logs and key metrics right after a release
