# Technical Playbook

This playbook suggests what needs to be done to build effective digital service on a technical level.  It is opinionated but backed by years of experience and drawn from best practices from the private sector and government. It breaks the software development discipline into 14 **actionable** plays. We do not enforce the plays to any team, but strongly recommend them. At CDS, we believe this playbook will provide the following outcomes:

- Set technical standard baseline across our community and product teams 
- Increase collaboration and re-use
- Build speed and consistency
- Streamline onboarding new developers, departments or partners
- Consolidate industry best practices and adapt them to our mission
- Realize economies of scale
- Mitigate risk and increase operational efficiency

We hope to refine it as we practice the plays everyday in our craft.
